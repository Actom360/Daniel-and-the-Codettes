/*
reads data from a given collection of pages in collection.txt
and generates an "inverted index" that provides a list (set) of
urls for every word in a given collection of pages. 

You need to "normalise" words by removing leading and trailing spaces
and converting all characters to lowercases before inserting words in
your index. In each list (set), duplicate urls are not allowed.
Your program should output this "inverted index" to a file named invertedIndex.txt.
The list should be alphabetically ordered, using ascending order.
